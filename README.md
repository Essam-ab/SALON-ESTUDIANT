# SALON-ESTUDIANT
- Lounge(Salon) for students to help them in their orientation. Salon-Estudiant has a coaching page in which the teacher teaches their student as well as a chat app and a 'stand' in which every university can teach and guide its own students.

## Getting Started
- To run this project you'll need a local server like (xampp, wamp..) for the php code.

## Installation
- install jquery and make sure that it isn't the slim version because you need ajax.
- import the database as 'swib_salon'
- open apache and mysql in the XAMPP CONTROL PANEL (or any other local server that you're using)
```
npm install jquery@3.5.0
```
